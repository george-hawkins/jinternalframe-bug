JInternalFrame bug demo
=======================

Run [`InternalFrameBugDemo`](src/main/java/com/example/InternalFrameBugDemo.java), click on window "Alpha" to make it focused, then click on the combo box in window "Beta". The dropdown menu of the combo box will pop down (as expected) but immediately be canceled. This may happen so quickly that you never even notice the menu.

The popdown menu is canceled by an ungrab event generated by the window that lost focus, i.e. "Alpha", as a result of you clicking on a component in window "Beta".

Prior to JDK 10.0.23, no such ungrab events were generated - they were introduced in commit [`4b8cfe5`](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/4b8cfe5a6058cdada1ad6efbb8f81e2f8f53a177) which was done to address [JDK-8173739](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8173739).

You can see the previous behavior (where the combo box menu remains visible rather than being canceled for no obvious reason) by running [`InternalFrameBugFixDemo`](src/main/java/com/example/InternalFrameBugFixDemo.java). Here a subclass of `JInternalFrame` is used where the `setSelected` and `dispose` methods are overridden such that the changes introduced by `4b8cfe5` are backed out.
